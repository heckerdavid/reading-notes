# Putting It All Together

## Thinking in React

- What is the single responsibility principle and how does it apply to components?

  - a component should ideally only do one thing
  - If it ends up growing, it should be decomposed into smaller sub-components

- What does it mean to build a ‘static’ version of your application?

  - a version that takes your data model and renders the UI but has no interactivity

- Once you have a static application, what do you need to add?

  - Interactivity

- What are the three questions you can ask to determine if something is state?

  - Is it passed in from a parent via props? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  - Does it remain unchanged over time? If so, it probably isn’t state.
  - Can you compute it based on any other state or props in your component? If so, it isn’t state.

- How can you identify where state needs to live?

  - Identify every component that renders something based on that state.
  - Find a common owner component (a single component above all the components that need the state in the hierarchy).
  - Either the common owner or another component higher up in the hierarchy should own the state.
  - If you can’t find a component where it makes sense to own the state, create a new component solely for holding the state and add it somewhere in the hierarchy above the common owner component.

## Higher-Order Functions

- What is a “higher-order function”?
  - Functions that operate on other functions, either by taking them as arguments or by returning them

- Explore the greaterThan function as defined in the reading. In your own words, what is line 2 of this function doing?
  - an arrow function evaluating if a yet to be defined(passed?) variable is greater than n

- Explain how either map or reduce operates, with regards to higher-order functions.
  - map is a standard array method that takes in an array (the one you use to call it) and some operative function (the arg you pass in), and returns a new array of the items output from the operative function
