# Authentication & Production Server

* JSON Web Token (JWT) is an open standard (RFC 7519) that defines a compact and self-contained way for securely transmitting information between parties as a JSON object. This information can be verified and trusted because it is digitally signed. JWTs can be signed using a secret (with the HMAC algorithm) or a public/private key pair using RSA or ECDSA.

* You’ve been running your app locally with python manage.py runserver. That’s a fine command, built for development convenience, but it’s not meant to be used as part of a production setup.

  * The docs are very adamant about this:

  * DO NOT USE THIS SERVER IN A PRODUCTION SETTING. It has not gone through security audits or performance tests.

    * If you want to run Django in production, be sure to use a production-ready web server like Nginx, and let your app be handled by a WSGI application server like Gunicorn.
