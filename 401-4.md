# Classes, Objects, and Recursion

## Classes and Objects

### Thinking recursively

* A recursive function is a function defined in terms of itself via self-referential expressions.
    * This means that the function will continue to call itself and repeat its behavior until some condition is met to return a result. All recursive functions share a common structure made up of two parts: base case and recursive case.

#### PyTest fixtures and coverage

* fixtures have explicit names and are activated by declaring their use from test functions, modules, classes or whole projects.

* fixtures are implemented in a modular manner, as each fixture name triggers a fixture function which can itself use other fixtures.

* fixture management scales from simple unit to complex functional testing, allowing to parametrize fixtures and tests according to configuration and component options, or to re-use fixtures across function, class, module or whole test session scopes.

* teardown logic can be easily, and safely managed, no matter how many fixtures are used, without the need to carefully handle errors by hand or micromanage the order that cleanup steps are added.
