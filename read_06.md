# Javascript

is javascript.

## Variables

JavaScript variables can be declared in three ways

- var
- let
- const

multiple variables can be declared at once
>var x = 1,
>y = 2,
>z = 3;

eg.
> var x = 5;
variable names must begin with a:

- letter
- $
- underscore

string addition is possible, if using strings and ints, ints will be treated as strings and output will be concatenated.
eg.
>var x = '5' + 2 + 3;
>x == '523'
