## Understanding the JS callstack

- What is a ‘call’?
  - function invocation

- How many ‘calls’ can happen at once?
  - one

- What does LIFO mean?
  - Last in first out

- Draw an example of a call stack and the functions that would need to be invoked to generate that call stack

  - `firstfunction`
  - `secondfunction`
  - `thirdfunction`

  -     function firstFunction(){
        throw new Error('Stack Trace Error');
        }

        function secondFunction(){
          firstFunction();
        }

        function thirdFunction(){
          secondFunction();
        }

        thirdFunction();

- What causes a Stack Overflow?
  - the browser/hosting environment has a maximum stack call that it can accommodate before throwing a stack error
  - recursive functions without an exit point can/will blow the stack

## JS Error messages

- What is a ‘reference error’?
  - use of a variable that is not yet declared

- What is a ‘syntax error’?
  - use of something that cannot be parsed in terms of syntax

- What is a ‘range error’?
  - manipulate an object with some kind of length and give it an invalid length

- What is a ‘type error’?
  - show up when the types (number, string and so on) you are trying to use or access are incompatible

- What is a breakpoint?
  - cam be added to stop your code execution at that point

- What does the word ‘debugger’ do in your code?
  - adds a break point
