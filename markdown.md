# this is my reading notes for markdown reading assignment

some information I saw is:

## heading two is created by using "##" followed by a space

### heading three follows the same pattern, except adding an additional #

- unordered list 
- is creared
- by using either
- "-" and then a space
- or
- "*" and then a space

to enter a [hyperlink](http://google.com) you simply put the word you want linked in brackets [] followed by the link in ()

you can mention someone by using the @ symbol followed by thier github username eg. @heckerdavid

new paragraphs are started by leaving blank lines between text in the file editor

you can ignore markdown syntax with the \ key. this allows you to show syntax that markdown would otherwise interpret. if i use \ followed by ## it displays:
\## 
which is obviously not displayed as a header
