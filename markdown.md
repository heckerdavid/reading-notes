# this is my reading notes for markdown reading assignment

some information I saw is:

## Github pages is the fastest, most direct way to get a webpage accessible on the internet. it uses your github profile and a repository that you create, and publishes a live webpage!
it does require a README.MD or an INDEX.HTML file to be in the repository. Today we will use a readme.md file with some basic markdown to produce content.
# Markdown Basics!

## heading two is created by using "##" followed by a space

### heading three follows the same pattern, except adding an additional \#

- unordered list 
- is creared
- by using either
- "-" and then a space
- or
- "*" and then a space

to enter a [hyperlink](http://google.com) you simply put the word you want linked in brackets [] followed by the link in ()

you can mention someone by using the @ symbol followed by thier github username eg. @heckerdavid

new paragraphs are started by leaving blank lines between text in the file editor

you can ignore markdown syntax with the \ key. this allows you to show syntax that markdown would otherwise interpret. if i use \ followed by ## it displays:
\## 
which is obviously not displayed as a header

~~mistakes~~ can be represented with strikethrough. this is done using the \~~ keys before and after the text you want lined out.

to quote the github docs:
>you can use \> to present a quote like this
