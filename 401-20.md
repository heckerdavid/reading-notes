# Django

## Getting started

* Django is a high-level Python web framework that enables rapid development of secure and maintainable websites. Built by experienced developers, Django takes care of much of the hassle of web development, so you can focus on writing your app without needing to reinvent the wheel. It is free and open source, has a thriving and active community, great documentation, and many options for free and paid-for support.

* Django helps you write software that is:

    * Complete
    * Versatile
    * Secure
    * Scalable
    * Maintainable
    * Portable

### Behind the scenes

* A python based web framework
* Django’s code is open source and available to all. Django’s organization is managed by a non-profit, the DSF, with a miniscule budget. And Django code is lead by a core team of volunteers, two paid Django Fellows, and a larger group of contributors.
