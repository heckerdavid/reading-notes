# Passing Functions as Props

## Lists and Keys

- What does .map() return?
  - iterates over an array and performs specified actions on items in the array

- If I want to loop through an array and display each value in JSX, how do I do that in React?
      const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
      const listItems = numbers.map((number) =>
        <li>{number}</li>
      );

- Each list item needs a unique ____.
  - key

- What is the purpose of a key?
  - a unique prop used when rendering lists in React
  - help react handle updating DOM  effectively

## The Spread Operator

- What is the spread operator?
  -     ...

- List 4 things that the spread operator can do.
  - Copying an array
  - Concatenating or combining arrays
  - Using Math functions
  - Using an array as arguments
  - Adding an item to a list
  - Adding to state in React
  - Combining objects
  - Converting NodeList to an array

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two arrays.
  -     let arr1 = [0, 1, 2]; 
        let arr2 = [3, 4, 5]; 
        arr1 = [...arr1, ...arr2];
        //  arr1 is now [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5]

- Give an example of using the spread operator to add a new item to an array.
  -     let arr1 = [0, 1, 2];
        let arr2 = [3, 4, 5];
        arr1 = [...arr2, ...arr1];
        //  arr1 is now [3, 4, 5, 0, 1, 2]

- Give an example of using the spread operator to combine two objects into one.
  -     let obj1 = { foo: 'bar', x: 42 };
        let obj2 = { foo: 'baz', y: 13 };
        let mergedObj = { ...obj1, ...obj2 };
        // Object { foo: "baz", x: 42, y: 13 }
