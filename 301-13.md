## Why Diversity Matters

- When are diversity efforts most successful?
  - when theyâ€™re driven by a commitment from company leaders

- Why do diverse companies perform better?
  - given that diverse teams are smarter and more creative than homogeneous ones, it is unsurprising that a wealth of research shows a strong correlation between diverse organizations and positive financial outcomes

  - When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups
