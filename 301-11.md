## SQL and NoSQL

Fill in the chart below with five differences between SQL and NoSQL databases:
| SQL |	NoSQL |
|-|-|
| Data used schema | Schema-less |
| Relations | No (or few) relations |
| Data is distributed across multiple tables | Data is merged or nested in a few collections |
| Horizontal scaling is difficult/impossible | Both horizontal and vertical scaling is possible |
| Limitations for read and write queries per second | Great for performance for mass (simple) read and and write requests |

- What kind of data is a good fit for an SQL database?
  - complex query intensive environment

- Give a real world example.
  - MySql

- What kind of data is a good fit a NoSQL database?
  - anything requiring flexibility and/or scale

- Give a real world example.
  - Craigslist

- Which type of database is best for hierarchical data storage?
  - NoSQL database fits better for the hierarchical data storage as it follows the key-value pair way of storing data similar to JSON data. NoSQL database are highly preferred for large data set (i.e for big data). Hbase is an example for this purpose

- Which type of database is best for scalability?
  - In most typical situations, SQL databases are vertically scalable. You can manage increasing load by increasing the CPU, RAM, SSD, etc, on a single server. On the other hand, NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable. You can just add few more servers easily in your NoSQL database infrastructure to handle the large traffic

## Part 2

- What does SQL stand for?
  - Structured Query Language

- What is a relational database?
  - tables of data tied together
  - `Relational Databases are called "Relational" because the whole database is based on Relational Algebra that Edgar Codd created. That algebra provides operations like projection and join. Relation here means a set of tuples` - Some guy on youtube

- What type of structure does a relational database work with?
  - tables

- What is a ‘schema’?
  - Fields(columns) of data in a table
  - the way data is organized, must be normalized

- What is a NoSQL database?
  - A DB not using SQL structure

- How does it work?
  - Data collections
  - collections contain documents
  - does not require schema

- What is inside of a Mongo database?
  - data in documents

- Which is more flexible - SQL or MongoDB? and why.
  - MongoDB
    - allows for storage of different formats of data
    - not required to be relational
    - allows for horizontal scaling

- What is the disadvantage of a NoSQL database?
  - duplicate data may be requiem
