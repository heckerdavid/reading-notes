# Serverless Functions

## What is serverless computing

Serverless is a cloud computing execution model that 

* Automatically provisions the computing resources required to run application code on demand, or in response to a specific event;

* Automatically scales those resources up or down in response to increased or decreased demand;

* Automatically scales resources to zero when the application stops running.
