# Pythonism

* Generator functions are syntactic sugar for writing objects that support the iterator protocol. Generators abstract away much of the boilerplate code needed when writing class-based iterators.
* The yield statement allows you to temporarily suspend execution of a generator function and to pass back values from it.
* Generators start raising StopIteration exceptions after control flow leaves the generator function by any means other than a yield statement.
