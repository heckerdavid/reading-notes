# React and Forms

## Forms

- What is a ‘Controlled Component’?
  - An input form element whose value is controlled by React
  - the React component that renders a form also controls what happens in that form on subsequent user input

- Should we wait to store the users responses from the form into state when they submit the form OR should we update the state with their responses as soon as they enter them? Why.
  - store it on submit
  - otherwise the value is updated every keystroke

- How do we target what the user is entering if we have an event handler on an input field?
  -     this.setState({value: event.target.value});

## Conditional (Ternary) Operator

- Why would we use a ternary operator?
  - less code involved

- Rewrite the following statement using a ternary statement:
-     if(x===y){
        console.log(true);
      } else {
        console.log(false);
      }

-     x === y ? console.log(true) : console.log(false)
