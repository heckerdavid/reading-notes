## CSS Layout

- normal flow
  - default behavior
  - each block level element is placed on a new line
  - inline elements will be placed next to each other as space allows
- relative positioning
  - this displays the element *relative* to its standard position
  - does not affect surrounding elements
- absolute positioning
  - positions element in relation to its *containing* element
  - taken out of normal flow -> affects surrounding elements
  - move on scroll
- fixed positioning
  - similar to absulute position
  - positions element relative to browser window
