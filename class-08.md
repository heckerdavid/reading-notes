## CSS Layout

- normal flow
  - default behavior
  - each block level element is placed on a new line
  - inline elements will be placed next to each other as space allows
- relative positioning
  - this displays the element *relative* to its standard position
  - does not affect surrounding elements
- absolute positioning
  - positions element in relation to its *containing* element
  - taken out of normal flow -> affects surrounding elements
  - move on scroll
- fixed positioning
  - similar to absulute position
  - positions element relative to browser window
- floating elements
  - out of normal flow
  - positioned in far right or far left of *containing* box
  - becomes block level
  - repositions other elements
- Z-Index
  - layers
  - higher numbers to the front
- clear
  - can be applied when you float mutlitple items
  - clear left insures no items touch the left side of the cleared item
  - can clear left right top or bottom
- different screen sizes
  - most web designers use 960-1000px wide pages
  - you can also use responsive elements instead of fixed width
