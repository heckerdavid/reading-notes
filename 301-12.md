# CRUD

## REST Status codes

- In your own words, describe what each group of status code represents:
  - 100’s = Informational

  - 200’s = Request was accepted

  - 300’s = Redirect, lets the client know the expected info is not available at the location they are requesting it from(anymore)

  - 400’s = Error from the client side, client should verify request parameters

  - 500’s = Error from the sever side

- What is a status code 202?
  - asynchronous processing of a request was accepted, maybe not complete yet

- What is a status code 308?
  - permanent redirect, if the resource will now be available at a new URL and the client should directly access it via the new URL in the future

- What code would you use if an update didn’t return data to a client?
  - 404 Not Found - This is the most natural of responses and should be used in the case that the client URL was wrong

- What code would you use if a resource used to exist but no longer does?
  - 410 Gone - This is like 404 but we know that the resource existed in the past, but it got deleted or somehow moved, and we don’t know where

- What is the ‘Forbidden’ status code?
  - 403 Forbidden - The client has authorized or doesn’t need to authorize itself, but still has no permissions to access the resource.

## REST API with Node, Express, and MongoDB

- Why do we need to pull our MongoDB database string out of our server and put it into our .env?
  - so you can test on localhost and deploy on not localhost

- What is middleware?
  - software between client and server

- What does app.use(express.json()) do?
  - lets the server accept json as a body instead of post/get

- What does the /:id mean in a route?
  - parameter
  - give you access to what is passed in along with the url request

- What is the difference between PUT and PATCH?
  - put creates an object, patch updates it without erasing previous data

- How do you make a default value in a schema?
  - default: value

- What does a 500 error status code mean?
  - there is an error on the server

- What is the difference between a status 200 and a status 201?
  - successful post request
