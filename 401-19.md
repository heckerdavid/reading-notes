## Regex with Python

* match()
    * returns a match object if the text matches the pattern. Otherwise, it returns None.

* search()
    * you scan through the given string/sequence, looking for the first location where the regular expression produces a match. It returns a corresponding match object if found, else returns None if no position in the string matches the pattern. Note that None is different from finding a zero-length match at some point in the string.

          Note: The match() function checks for a match only at the beginning of the string (by default), whereas the search() function checks for a match anywhere in the string.

* findall(pattern, string, flags=0)
    * Finds all the possible matches in the entire sequence and returns them as a list of strings. Each returned string represents one match.

* split(string, maxsplit=0)
    * This splits the strings wherever the pattern matches and returns a list. If the optional argument maxsplit is nonzero, then the maximum 'maxsplit' number of splits are performed.

* start() - Returns the starting index of the match.
* end() - Returns the index where the match ends.
* span() - Return a tuple containing the (start, end) positions of the match.
