# Django REST framework and Docker

* Docker is a way to run Linux containers
* Containers are a lightweight alternative to Virtual Machines
* Dockerfile is a list of instructions for creating an image
* Images are made up of one or more layers
* Containers are a running instance of an image
* docker-compose.yml controls how to run the container
* Containers are stateless and ephemeral in nature. We can link the local filesystem via volumes but things become more complex with databases (which we didnâ€™t cover here).
