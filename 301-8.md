# APIs

- What does REST stand for?
  - Representational State Transfer

- REST APIs are designed around ____.
  - resources, which are any kind of object, data, or service that can be accessed by the client

- What is an identifier of a resource? Give an example.
  - URI
  - `https://adventure-works.com/orders/1`

- What are the most common HTTP verbs?
  - GET, POST, PUT, PATCH, and DELETE.

- What should the URIs be based on?
  - nouns (the resource) and not verbs (the operations on the resource)

- Give an example of a good URI.
  - `https://adventure-works.com/orders`

- What does it mean to have a ‘chatty’ web API? Is this a good or a bad thing?
  - probably a bad thing as chatty APIs return a large number of small resources, increasing the number of requests required
  - however returning too much unneeded data will increase latency

- What status code does a successful GET request return?
  - A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK)

- What status code does an unsuccessful GET request return?
  - If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found)

- What status code does a successful POST request return?
  - If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created)

- What status code does a successful DELETE request return?
  - If the delete operation is successful, the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
