## Domain Models

- When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
- Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
- Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing one job well.
- Create instances using the new keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
- Store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
- Use the this variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.
