## Encryption, Decryption, & Hacking

Thanks to this exploration of the Caesar Cipher, we now understand the three key aspects of data encryption:

* Encryption: scrambling the data according to a secret key (in this case, the alphabet shift).
* Decryption: recovering the original data from scrambled data by using the secret key.
* Code cracking: uncovering the original data without knowing the secret, by using a variety of clever techniques.

### Ceasar Cipher

In cryptography, a Caesar cipher, also known as Caesar's cipher, the shift cipher, Caesar's code or Caesar shift, is one of the simplest and most widely known encryption techniques. It is a type of substitution cipher in which each letter in the plaintext is replaced by a letter some fixed number of positions down the alphabet. For example, with a left shift of 3, D would be replaced by A, E would become B, and so on. The method is named after Julius Caesar, who used it in his private correspondence.[1]
