## List Comprehensions

*     multiples_of_three = [ x*3 for x in range(10) ]

*     even_numbers = [ x for x in range(1,20) if x % 2 == 0]

*     authors = ["Ernest Hemingway","Langston Hughes","Frank Herbert","Toni Morrison","Emily Dickson","Stephen King"] # create an acronym from the first letter of the author's names letters = [ name[0] for name in authors ]

*     lower_case = [ letter.lower() for letter in ['A','B','C'] ]
        upper_case = [ letter.upper() for letter in ['a','b','c'] ]

*     # add a filter so we only double even numbers
        even_nums = [double(x) for x in range(1,10) if x%2 == 0]

*     nums = [x+y for x in [1,2,3] for y in [10,20,30]]
