## How to use Random Module

    import random
    print random.randint(0, 5)   #0-5

    import random
    random.random() * 100   #0-100

    import random
    myList = [2, 109, False, 10, "Lorem", 482, "Ipsum"]
    random.choice(myList)

    from random import shuffle
    x = [[i] for i in range(10)]
    shuffle(x)
    Output:
    # print x  gives  [[9], [2], [7], [0], [4], [5], [3], [1], [8], [6]]

### What is Risk Analysis

risk analysis is the process of identifying the risks in applications or software that you built and prioritizing them to test

* Effect – To assess risk by Effect. In case you identify a condition, event or action and try to determine its impact.

* Cause – To assess risk by Cause is opposite of by Effect. Initialize scanning the problem and reach to the point that could be the most probable reason behind that.

* Likelihood – To assess risk by Likelihood is to say that there is a probability that a requirement won’t be satisfied.

How to perform Risk Analysis?
There are three steps:

* Searching the risk

* Analyzing the impact of each individual risk

* Measures for the risk identified

#### Test Coverage

* [Martin Fowler] would say you are doing enough testing if the following is true:

        You rarely get bugs that escape into production, and
        You are rarely hesitant to change some code for fear it will cause production bugs.
