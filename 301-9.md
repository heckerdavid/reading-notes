# Functional Programming

## Functional Programming Concepts

- What is functional programming?
  - Functional programming is a programming paradigm — a style of building the structure and elements of computer programs — that treats computation as the evaluation of mathematical functions and avoids changing-state and mutable data — Wikipedia - Medium.com

- What is a pure function and how do we know if something is a pure function?
  - It returns the same result if given the same arguments (it is also referred as deterministic)
  - It does not cause any observable side effects

- What are the benefits of a pure function?
  - Pure functions are stable, consistent, and predictable. Given the same parameters, pure functions will always return the same result
  - The code’s easier to test

- What is immutability?
  - When data is immutable, its state cannot change after it’s created

- What is Referential transparency?
  - if a function consistently yields the same result for the same input, it is referentially transparent.
  - `pure functions + immutable data = referential transparency`

## Node.js

- What is a module?
  - Basically a JS file

- What does the word ‘require’ do?
  - returns the exported from whatever is passed to the require func

- How do we bring another module into the file the we are working in?
  - `let someVariable = require('./pathToTheThingINeed')`

- What do we have to do to make a module available?
  - `module.exports = theThingsToExportFromThisFile;`
