# Version Control

Version Control Systems (VCS) allow for tracking and storing of a project at different stages in its life, this allows you to empliment new features without 
worrying about destoring your project. Cause a massive bug you cant fix? Simply revert to a previous version. Hate the new feature you spend weeks on? revert it away.

### VCS can be
- Local
- Centralized (CVCS)
- Distributed (DVCS)

##Git

Git is a extremely popular DVCS.

- allows for multiple developers to work simultaniously on the same project
- keeps a retrieveable, historical record of changes
