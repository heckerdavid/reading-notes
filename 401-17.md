### What is Web Scraping

#### How to Scrape Websites without getting blocked

Websites can use different mechanisms to detect a scraper/spider from a normal user. Some of these methods are enumerated below:

* Unusual traffic/high download rate especially from a single client/or IP address within a short time span.
* Repetitive tasks performed on the website in the same browsing pattern – based on an assumption that a human user won’t perform the same repetitive tasks all the time.
* Checking if you are real browser – A simple check is to try and execute javascript. Smarter tools can go a lot more and check your Graphic cards and CPUs to make sure you are coming from real browser.
* Detection through honeypots – these honeypots are usually links which aren’t visible to a normal user but only to a spider. When a scraper/spider tries to access the link, the alarms are tripped.
