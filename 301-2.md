# State and Props

## React Component Lifecycle Events

- Based off the diagram, what happens first, the ‘render’ or the ‘componentDidMount’?
  - render

- What is the very first thing to happen in the lifecycle of React?
  - constructor

- Put the following things in the order that they happen:

  - constructor
  - render
  - componentDidMount
  - React Updates
  - componentWillUnmount

- What does componentDidMount do?
  - a method run after mounting, lets you load anything requiring a network request or initialize the DOM
  - a "do this stuff after mounting" function

## State vs Props

- What types of things can you pass in the props?
  - anything you want passed down from the parent to the child, similar to function arguments

- What is the big difference between props and state?
  - Props are passed into a component (handled outside of component), State is handled inside of the component

- When do we re-render our application?
  - anytime state is changed

- What are some examples of things that we could store in state?
  - anything you are handling inside of the component
  - form
  - input element
  - checkbox
